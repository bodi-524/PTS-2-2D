TODO: Need to paraphrase to give a more fantasy feel
You wake up surrounded by filth and husk, 
there is a particular animal musk, a darkness surrounding you, it restricts your vision. 
There are torches hanging on a central pillar of what seems to be a <color=\#aa1234> small barn </color>.
You turn your gaze downwards and see you are wearing

    You go towards a large container with water and start to clean the filth of your boots and {clothes}

You go to sleep for 5 more minutes

You get up in the low light conditions,  {i_wanna_build_a_wtf: you feel the coldness in the temperature, since you are naked} and start exploring the surroundings. 
You see there are multiple animals in the barn, from horses to cows. A peculiar sound catches your attention. It seems like a animal crying for help, you start walking towards it. 
When you reach the corner of the barn, you see a white calf lying on the ground, shaking and crying for help. Another cow going restless in the next enclosure. Presumably its mother.
What do you do next ?
    * Try to save the calf. It seems the cold has seeped into the calf and its suffering from frostbite.{i_wanna_build_a_mage: I cover it with my robe} {i_wanna_build_a_wtf: I use my naked body to wrap myself around the calf}

    - - You hear rattling of enclosures, and a loud clank. You turn around to see, its a rampaging bull, running towards you. You succesfully dodge the bull's assault. 
    What will you do next ?

        The bull runs towards you with his horned head pointing toward ground, and scoops you up like one of those bob the builder machinations. 
        You feel the sensation of flying, it was shortlived. 
        - - - You fall down towards the ground, followed by some hoof massage.

The soft light that had been straining your eyes is now gone, as if something has shrouded it entirely. In the sudden absence, you feel a presenceâ€”something is near. But you ignore it and continue sleeping.
- After some time, the lingering putrid smell of the barn has grown more intense. You feel something warm on your face, you intinctively wipe it off your face and feel a weird sensation of something in semi-solid state like a sticky paste.
- By the time you come to your senses, the damage has already been done. You wake up to the sight of black hair dangling over your face. The realisation of that sensation and smell feels you with disgust, sadness and anger.

You begin to wash yourself with the water from a nearby container. As you clean, you notice faint rays of sunlight filtering into the space. The cheerful chirping of birds fills the air, and you realize the soft glow outside is the first light of dawn breaking over the horizon. 
You move toward the window, peering outside to take in the view.
- Clustered before you are humble houses crafted from straw and timber, their design unmistakably reminiscent of a medieval age. The faint sound of footsteps reaches your ears, growing louder as someone approaches the barn. You turn toward the entrance, your gaze fixed, eager to catch a glimpse of the approaching figure."

You see the figure of a maiden approach. She has blonde hair covering her coral blue eyes. Here complexion is white as that of an angel. But her body is frail, she has dark circles around her eyes. You wonder if she is a helper at this place.
- You try to get her attention in the most meek way possible. Appearing small,non-threatening, bowing as low as possible with hands held high. 
* "Hello there. . ."
->help_me_waifu_2
* You scan the woman's figure top to down "Mmmm.. Mmmm.. MMMM!.. (shaking your head left to right with closed eyes) "Marvellous"

    - - The woman instinctively wraps her arms around her breasts, trying to hide them from your prying perverted gaze.
    * * "Forgive me my lady" - I get down on one knee with my head bowed down.

- She is shocked to see me in the barn, the fear is visible from her expressions. She quickly takes glance at all possible exits. 
You realize her intentions, and back away from her,  giving her some space, so she would realize you are not a threat. {i_wanna_build_a_wtf: My lack of clothes is certainly not helping, you grab a pan and hide my jewels}
You try to sudbue her fears by the best smile you can muster, and signalling that you am not some lunatic. During your act and posturing, you slip over some horse shit and fall down on your face. You hear a faint giggling while you get back up. 
The blonde girl approaches me, and offers me a rag to wipe off the shit. You accept it, and says "Thanks"
- She helps you get up, and asks 
"Who are you, and why are you in my family's barn."
How do you reply ?
* Absurd lie

I can offer some assistance, but I have responsibilities I cannot ignore,' Rez murmurs, her eyes fixed on the rough wooden planks of the barn floor. The question takes her by surprise, leaving her momentarily speechless. No one has ever cared enough to ask her what she wants."

You decide to visit Clearport's port, hoping there must be something special about it, since the city is literally named after it.

You continue to follow the path towards the port, you take the path through a dark alley, thats when you sense a gloomy presence in there. There is a person with dity white robes and standing with support of a worn out stick. Sensing your presence, he lifts up his head blocking my path and staring at me directly.
