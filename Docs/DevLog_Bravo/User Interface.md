Designed the User Interface on Lunacy, and by God it is such a . . Its free.
It crashed 6 times, but the progress was not lost. I lost my access to Premium version of figma which i got from student developer pack along with Github essentials. 

Anyways, I designed some basic options, firstly on paper, and then a sort of detailed fine tuning. I have never done this sort of thing. I got hold of a palette for colors. I got the idea from one of half completed courses on udemy and from backtracking Polyducks posts via google search. Polyducks is the creator of '[Mushroom Hunt](https://polyducks.itch.io/mushroom-hunt)'. the art on that games are phenomenal and so different. Its pixel but on some other level. Its actually ASCII symbols, and its very hard (I tried).

Getting hold of the palette from Lospec, the creator [Toby_Yasha](https://lospec.com/palette-list/ty-monster-dungeons-16)

I used it as a base for creating the UI, which are as below. Though the assets will be different and will have a medieval feel. But for prototyping, i think they are good enough.

Option A

Option A has a subdivision of 1/4 on both sides horizontally and has a collapsible menu for all the stats, information and inventory. With all the basic important player stats like hp, level and mana visible on the main screen and the specific button like menu and map on the bottom. 
This being a text based adventure fantasy, has a good enough big text dialog box and the options to choose below it. I might alter it, if i plan to add art into the mix. There are two huge left and right arrows they allow to go back in the story or move forward. I dont think they will have any important use case initially. Since the story will be pretty much linear in the beginning but maybe it will make sense, once it gets into branches, allowing player to move back. I can add a limited count of redo, and charge players if they want more. Hehehe.


Option B

Not much changed, but he screen is small and the menu now covers the whole screen, i can use this for smartphone build. 

option C

Still same, but the best one in my opinion.  1/5 on both sides and an always open menu, allowing the player to always be aware of their stats and making decisions based on all the info. Also the huge spread seems logical for PC build. 

Next step is to start with coding for it, and get a running prototype, since the story is the most intensive task in this project. I have also started working that. I will add another post, focusing on that, but here is a part of what i drafted today.
I am using the reference of [Dependency chart](https://grumpygamer.com/puzzle_dependency_charts/) and some experience of drafting flowchart and state diagram for one of my subjects i took in University, Decision Science.

There are no connections because its still a work in progress.
