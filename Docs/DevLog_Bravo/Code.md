## Code for our project

We start with setting up a basic 2D Built in render pipeline for 2022LTS and start with setting up the Directories in the asset. (the GitHub version control has already been set up so not going much into it.)

Based on [Tutorial notes](Misc/Tutorial%20notes.md) from rainman. 
We will be using Event Driven Architecture. 
This is the initial structure of the code base, just a preliminary design with some scripts is given as below.

I think i can expand on these after some implementation. 

This is just a preliminary design and is definitely going to change. I could not start the coding without a blueprint, i felt clueless.
