I will paste some prompt responses, that seem relevant of my approach below. 

**Phase 1: The Narrative Core (Ink-Centric)**

**Focus:** First, prioritize the narrative flow and structure _within Ink_.    
**Approach:**    
1. **Outline the Main Story:** Write a high-level outline of the main story arc, including major plot points, choices, and potential branches.
2. **Chunk the Story:** Divide the main story into logical sections or chapters. These will become your primary modules. Each section should have:
	- A starting point (an Ink knot).
	- A series of events/dialogues.
	- Potential branching points.
	- An ending point (another Ink knot).
3. **Prototype a Section in Ink:** Choose one of these sections and write it out _completely_ in Ink. Focus on:
	- **Core Dialogue:** Create the main dialogue interactions.
	- **Choice Points:** Implement the most important choices in this section and how they diverge the narrative.
	- **Variables:** Introduce Ink variables to track player choices, character relationships, and any other important factors.
	- **Test** Test this section of code in unity.
4. **Define Key Variables:** As you write, keep track of the key Ink variables you're using. These variables will become your "interface" between Ink and your C# code.
5. **Define knots**: Have a clear name for each knot and what is its function.
**Why This First?:** By focusing on Ink first, you're solidifying the most unique and vital part of your game: the story. It will guide all subsequent system design.
    

**Phase 2: The Quest and Progression Layer**
**Focus:** Create a system to link the Ink modules together and guide players through the story.
**Approach:**
1. **Quest as Narrative Chunks:** Think of quests as the formal containers for the Ink modules.
2. **Quest Structure:** A quest will essentially consist of:
	- **Entry Point:** The Ink knot where the quest starts.
	- **Progression Knots:** The Ink knots that mark the "checkpoints" or stages within the quest.
	- **Exit Point:** The Ink knot where the quest ends.
3. **Minimalist Quest Data:** Keep the quest data itself simple. You need:
	- A unique ID.
	- A starting Ink knot.
	- A list of "progression knots" (or requirements in the original idea).
	- An ending knot (or a "completed" flag).
4. **Quest Manager (Simplified):** Your quest manager is now just a navigator. It:
	- Starts a quest (enters the starting Ink knot).
	- Tracks which "progression knots" have been reached.
	- Knows when the ending knot has been reached (quest complete).
	- Determines which quest to start next, based on previous choices.
5. **No More Complex Quest Requirements (Initially):** Initially, forget about complex "kill X monsters" or "collect Y items" requirements _within_ a quest. If those things are part of the story, handle them _within Ink_ as dialogue and choices.
6. **Link quest and story**: Each quest should follow the story, not the opposite.
7. **Flow**: The flow will be as follow. The player starts a quest, the player is directed to ink, there, a series of dialogues and choices. After each choice or sequence of dialogues, the system should check if it advance the quest. Once completed, the quest will finish.
**Why This Second?:** This phase ensures the player is guided through the story you've created. It simplifies the quest system so that it works for you, not against you.

**Phase 3: Hero Class Integration**
**Focus:** Inject hero class differences into the narrative.    
**Approach:**    
1. **Class-Specific Variables:** Decide on a few key Ink variables that will represent the player's class (e.g., `player_class = "Warrior"`, `player_class = "Mage"`).
2. **Class-Based Story Sections:** In Ink, you will create entire sections or smaller lines of dialogue that are conditional on these variables.
	`if (player_class == "Warrior") { ... } else if (player_class == "Mage")`
	`if (player_class_mage_quest1Completed){}`
3. **Class-Specific Quests:** Some quests could be exclusive to certain classes. You'd manage this in your Quest Manager.
4. **Link to stats:** Link the choices and dialogues of each class to the stats.
5. **Early Implementation:** Even if you only have a few class-specific lines at first, this starts the process of class differentiation.
**Why This Third?:** This is a layer on top of your core story. Get the story and basic progression working first.
    

**Phase 4: Advanced Features (Iteration)**
**Focus:** Refine and expand.    
**Approach:**    
1. **Complex Requirements (If Needed):** _After_ you have the core system working, consider adding back in complex requirements (kill X monsters, collect Y items) if they make sense within the story. You would handle them with `Requirement` class, as we discussed earlier.
2. **Consequences:** Track major player choices over time. Show how they affect the world and later quests.
3. **Refine Class Differentiation:** Make class differences more dramatic and meaningful.
4. **Polish the Ink:** Go back and make the dialogue writing as strong as possible.
5. **Test** Test everything.
**Why This Last?:** This phase is all about taking your already functional game and making it even better.


I intend to utilize this approach for the next steps in the development.
